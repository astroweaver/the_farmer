    "\n",
    "First you must have the following data files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An image you wish to detect on\n",
    "- An image (or images) you wish to model on\n",
    "- An image (or images) you wish to force those models onto\n",
    "\n",
    "The detection image and model image may be the same, and you may not have other bands to force photometry onto.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these, you will also want a robust inverse variance weight image, and probably a boolean (1/0) mask file. 1's are valid pixels, 0's are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your detection image should be optimized for detection, even if it's not in sensible units (e.g. a stack, color-image, or CHIMEAN). It's just to get the number of sources, a guess location, and a segmentation map.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some terminology should be introduced:**\n",
    "- A **brick** is a cut-out of the larger image, for computational ease.\n",
    "- A **blob** is a cut-out of a group of nearby sources, again for computational ease.\n",
    "- **detection** means having to do with the detection image\n",
    "- **modeling** means having to do with the model image\n",
    "- **multiband** means having to do with the (likely) multiple forced photometry images\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearby models must be modelled simultaneously. This is decided by dilating the segmentation map by a morphological structure function, joined, and re-labeled. Sources within this 'blob' are jointly modeled. The models are optimized using a decision tree to determine the model type. The solution models are then optimized together (to ensure a fair optimization) one last time where the model parameters are finalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model decision tree:**\n",
    " \n",
    "1. PointSource -- or -- SimpleGalaxy\n",
    "2. ExpGalaxy -- or -- DevGalaxy\n",
    "3. Composite Galaxy\n",
    "\n",
    "Models have different profiles and number of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PointSource :: basic PSF model. 3 parameters: (x, y) and flux.\n",
    "- SimpleGalaxy :: For nearly resolved sources. Exponential wings and dev core. 3 parameters: (x, y) and flux.\n",
    "- ExpGalaxy ::  Exponentially declining profile. 5 parameters: (x,y), flux, position angle, axis-ratio, and effective radius.\n",
    "- DevGalaxy :: de Vaucouleurs profile. 5 parameters: (x,y), flux, position angle, axis-ratio, and effective radius.\n",
    "- Composite :: Exponential wings and dev core. 10 parameters: (x, y),  total flux, fraction of flux in DevGalaxy, and position angle, axis-ratio, and effective radius for each Exp and Dev components.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: (x,y) may be frozen to the position solution at the PointSource stage in the config file under FREEZE_POSITION.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimzation, in brief, proceeds by maximizing likelihood. The likelihood is calculated by summing in quadriture the per-pixel chi values (that is, {data - model} * weight). If your weights are unreliable, so will your models, fluxes, and uncertainties! \n",

    "The Farmer provides a great deal of flexibility. However, that means that the user must carefully configure the data and input parameters..."

    "A Brick is a section of the larger mosaic which contains some sources. There are three kinds of bricks, corresponding to your detection, modelling, and multiband images. A brick includes your science image, weight, and mask. It will always include a weight and mask, even if you do not supply one. In that case, the weights will be all 1's and the mask will be all 0s. \n",

This way a source with a centroid near the edge of the brick is not cut off. Instead, the information is still there in the buffer zone. Note: this can still cause issues when nearby sources as separated by the buffer, but this should be rare. \n",

Ideally, you want number of pixels along one axis of the mosaic to be integer divisible by the number of bricks along that axis. For example, if your image is 20,000 pixels in one axis, you might chose 2,000 pixels along that axis for the brick size, giving you 10 bricks along that axis. \n",
