### Welcome to The Farmer's documentation!

**The Farmer** is a suite of photometry routines geared towards deep, multi-wavelength galaxy surveys. By fitting simple parametric surface brightness profiles provided by The Tractor ([Lang et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft04008L/abstract)), The Farmer is able to measure precision photometry even in deeply crowded fields -- provided a suitable high resolution detection image. Brief documentation is provided in the form of an example script and tutorial-style ipython notebook.

The code has been used to build a number of galaxy survey catalogs including COSMOS2020 ([Weaver et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...11W/abstract)), SHELA ([Leung et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230100908L/abstract)), and H20 (Zalesky, in preparation). 

A citable paper will appear shortly in ApJS and ArXiv, an advanced copy of which can be found in docs/.

If you are interested in using the code for your own work, we **strongly recommend** that you get in touch with us at [john.weaver.astro@gmail.com](john.weaver.astro@gmail.com). Of course you're welcome to clone and fork at your leisure, but we'd be happy to show you the ropes first!

For users looking for the code as it was developed for the COSMOS2020 catalog and the paper can checkout the 'TheFarmer_v1' branch where the code has been made publicly available in the spirit of transparency as documentation for these catalog papers. The branch is not being actively developed.
