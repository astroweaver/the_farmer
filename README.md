### Welcome to The Farmer's documentation!

**The Farmer** is a suite of photometry routines geared towards deep, multi-wavelength galaxy surveys. By fitting simple parametric surface brightness profiles provided by The Tractor ([Lang et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft04008L/abstract)), The Farmer is able to measure precision photometry even in deeply crowded fields -- provided a suitable high resolution detection image. Brief documentation is provided in the form of an example script and tutorial-style ipython notebook.

The code has been used to build a number of galaxy survey catalogs including COSMOS2020 ([Weaver et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...11W/abstract)), SHELA ([Leung et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230100908L/abstract)), and H20 (Zalesky, in preparation). That being said, users should be aware that this code is made publically available in the spirit of transparancy as documentation for these catalog papers. **It is no longer being actively developed.** Instead, [a top-to-bottom re-write](https://github.com/astroweaver/the_farmer_v2) is nearing completion that is far more user friendly, more capable, faster, and with fewer drawbacks: [https://github.com/astroweaver/the_farmer_v2](https://github.com/astroweaver/the_farmer_v2).

A citable paper is in review, an advanced copy of which can be found in this repo.

If you are interested in using the code for your own work, we **strongly recommend** that you get in touch with us at [john.weaver.astro@gmail.com](john.weaver.astro@gmail.com). Of course you're welcome to clone and fork at your leasure, but we'd be happy to show you the ropes first!
