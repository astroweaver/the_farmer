### Welcome to The Farmer's documentation!

**The Farmer** is a suite of photometry routines geared towards deep, multi-wavelength galaxy surveys. By fitting simple parametric surface brightness profiles provided by The Tractor ([Lang et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft04008L/abstract)), The Farmer is able to measure precision photometry even in deeply crowded fields -- provided a suitable high resolution detection image. Brief documentation is provided in the form of an example script and tutorial-style ipython notebook.

The code has been used to build a number of galaxy survey catalogs including COSMOS2020 ([Weaver et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...11W/abstract)), SHELA ([Leung et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230100908L/abstract)), and H20 (Zalesky, in preparation). 

For those interested in working with the code highlighted in our [recent paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231007757W/abstract), please check out the branch "TheFarmer_v1" or download it from the release list on the right, but note that this earlier version of the code has since been superceded.

When publishing results using our software, please cite [Weaver et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231007757W/abstract). A copy of the paper can be found in docs/.

If you are interested in using the code for your own work, we **strongly recommend** that you get in touch with us at [john.weaver.astro@gmail.com](john.weaver.astro@gmail.com). Of course you're welcome to clone and fork at your leisure, but we'd be happy to show you the ropes first!
