**Model photometry for deep, multi-wavelength galaxy surveys.**

The Farmer measures precise multi-band fluxes and morphologies by fitting parametric surface brightness profiles — point sources, exponential disks, de Vaucouleurs bulges, and composite models — simultaneously for groups of blended sources. The fitting engine is [The Tractor](https://github.com/dstndstn/tractor) (Lang et al. 2016). Given a high-resolution detection image, The Farmer recovers accurate photometry even in the most crowded fields.

The code underpins several major survey catalogs:

## How it works

The Farmer divides a survey mosaic into a grid of rectangular **bricks**. Within each brick, sources detected in the high-resolution image are grouped into small clusters (typically 1–5 neighbors) and fitted simultaneously. Fitted morphologies are then held fixed while fluxes are measured across every photometric band.

```
Survey Mosaic
    ↓
Brick Grid (N × M tiles)
    ↓  per brick:
Source Detection (SEP)  →  Segmentation map
    ↓
Source Grouping (morphological dilation)
    ↓  per group:
Model Determination (PointSource → SimpleGalaxy → Exp → deV → Composite)
    ↓
Forced Photometry (frozen morphology, free fluxes per band)
    ↓
HDF5 brick  +  FITS catalog
```

## Getting started

### 1. Set up your data directories

```bash
mkdir -p data/{external,interim/{bricks,psfmodels,logs},output/{figures,catalogs,ancillary}}
```

### 2. Configure

Copy `config/config.py` and edit it to point to your images:

```python
PATH_DATA = '/path/to/your/data/'

DETECTION = {
    'science': '/path/to/data/external/detection_chimean.fits',
    'subtract_background': True,
    'backtype': 'flat',
    'backregion': 'mosaic',
}

BANDS = {}
BANDS['hsc_i'] = {
    'science':  '/path/to/data/external/hsc_i.fits',
    'weight':   '/path/to/data/external/hsc_i_weight.fits',
    'psfmodel': '/path/to/data/interim/psfmodels/hsc_i.fits',
    'subtract_background': True,
    'zeropoint': 31.4,
}
# add more bands ...

N_BRICKS    = (2, 4)         # 2 columns × 4 rows
MODEL_BANDS = ['hsc_i']      # bands used for morphology fitting
```

Run Python from the directory that **contains** `config/` (not from inside it).

### 3. Validate, build, detect, model, photometer

```python
import farmer

farmer.validate()              # check paths, WCS, PSF models

farmer.build_bricks()          # cut stamps from mosaics, save HDF5
farmer.detect_sources_lite()   # detect sources (memory-efficient)
farmer.generate_models()       # fit morphologies
farmer.photometer()            # measure fluxes in all bands
```

### 4. Inspect results

```python
brick = farmer.load_brick(1)
brick.summary()

# Dig into a specific group interactively
group = farmer.quick_group(brick_id=1, group_id=42)
group.farm()   # determine models + photometry + plots
```

## Tips

**Start small.** Set `N_BRICKS = (1, 1)` and `NCPUS = 0` for your first run. A single brick in serial mode makes it easy to read log output and catch configuration errors before committing to a full survey run.

**Detection image matters.** The detection image drives source positions and morphologies. Use the highest-resolution, deepest image available — a chi-mean stack of your best optical bands is ideal. The photometric bands do not need to match its pixel scale.

**PSF preparation.** The Farmer expects PSFEx-format PSF models. Use `bin/prep_psf.py` to clip, normalize, and optionally resample a raw PSF stamp. A mismatched PSF is the most common cause of large reduced chi-squared values.

**Adding bands later.** You can add photometric bands to existing bricks without rebuilding from scratch:

```python
farmer.update_bricks(bands=['irac_ch1'])
farmer.photometer(bands=['irac_ch1'])
```

**Parallel processing.** Set `NCPUS = 8` (or however many cores you have) for production runs. Groups are distributed one at a time across workers, keeping memory usage flat.

**Timeout protection.** Long-running or diverging groups can stall a run. Set `GROUP_TIMEOUT = 120` (seconds) to skip them automatically and continue.
